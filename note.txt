*****************************************************

Introduction:
- SASS is an extension to CSS that can help us write more fexible style
- Use variable, functions, conditional statements and more.
- split our SASS files up into modules, making it easier to keep on top of CSS for large project.
- SASS is written in RUBY

NB: The browser will not understand our SASS code, therefore we need to translate it into CSS code.

What we should know first?
- SASS looks similar with a programming language, so we should be comfortable with those progrmming fundamentals
  such as functions, variables, condition,... 
- CSS

Installing and compiling SASS:
- There are 2 ways to install SASS on our computer:
  First of all, by using command line but for that we need to install Rubi first because it is writting with it.
  And then by using a stand alone application.
  Here is the link https://sass-lang.com/install

  All steps by using command line:
  - install Rubi (https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
  - add this path: source\Ruby31-x64\bin it on path variable.
  - install sass 
    > gem install sass
    > sass -v (to check if sass is installed)

What is SASS?
- SASS is a CSS extension language, and gives our CSS superpower.
- SASS is an easiest way for developper to write CSS but we need to translate it to CSS code so that the browser can 
understand the code.

There are two syntax to write SASS code:

example:
  .sass (don't need brackets)
  
  $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif
  $primary-color: #333

  body
    font: 100% $font-stack
    color: $primary-color


  .scss

  $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  $primary-color: #333;

  body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
  }

  .css
  body {
    font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
    color: #333;
  }

How to compile SASS?
With visual studio, we can use live compiler sass extension.
After installing it, set your json setting (visual studio setting).

- The map css file tell us about the location of sass file.
